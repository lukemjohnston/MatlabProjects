# MatlabProjects
Three of my Matlab projects from Numerical Analysis course.
each project has a pdf file with a detailed desription of the problem, the math theory being used to solve probelm, and the final results.



Project 1 - GPS
* gpsNewton.m
* newtonM.m
* testGPS.m
* testGPSnewton.m



Project 2 - Astronomer Spectral Line
* SpectralLine.m



Project 3 - Baseball Pitch Trajectory
